For more details, please refer to the [API documentation](https://scafi.github.io/macro-swarm/api/it/unibo/scafi/index.html).

MacroSwarm is a field-based libraries for expressing swarm behaviors in a declarative way.
It is based on [ScaFi](), a scala library for programming aggregate computing systems.
It supports a large variety of swarm behaviors, including collective movement, shape formation, team formation, and collective planning.

This library does not provide any simulation environment, but it is possible to use it with [Alchemist](https://alchemistsimulator.github.io/).
In the [alchemist](/guide/alchemist.html) section of the guide, we provide a quick tutorial on how to use MacroSwarm with Alchemist.
