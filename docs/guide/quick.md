MacroSwarm is a field-based libraries for expressing swarm behaviors in a declarative way.
It is based on [ScaFi](), a scala library for programming aggregate computing systems.
It supports a large variety of swarm behaviors, including collective movement, shape formation, team formation, and collective planning.

More details about the library can be found in the [API documentation](https://scafi.github.io/macro-swarm/api/it/unibo/scafi/index.html)
and in the main concepts section of the [guide](/guide/concepts.html).

This library does not provide any simulation environment, but it is possible to use it with [Alchemist](https://alchemistsimulator.github.io/).
In the [alchemist](/guide/alchemist.html) section of the guide, we provide a quick tutorial on how to use MacroSwarm with Alchemist,
presented in a scientific paper at [COORDINATION 2023](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371587547_MacroSwarm_A_Field-Based_Compositional_Framework_for_Swarm_Programming).
