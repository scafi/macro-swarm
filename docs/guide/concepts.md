It is based on [ScaFi](), a scala library for programming aggregate computing systems.
It supports a large variety of swarm behaviors, including collective movement, shape formation, team formation, and collective planning.

More details about the library can be found in the [API documentation](https://scafi.github.io/macro-swarm/api/)

This library does not provide any simulation environment, but it is possible to use it with [Alchemist](https://alchemistsimulator.github.io/).
